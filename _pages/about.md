Hi there! I'm Yida Bao, an statistic teacher at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Born and raised in Shanghai, my academic journey eventually led me to Auburn University. You may find my CV [HERE](../assets/CV.pdf).

Outside the classroom and research lab, you’ll often find me running—a sport that keeps me grounded and energized. I’ve competed in several Marathon races and enjoy setting personal challenges. I’m also an avid fan of Auburn Tigers football—nothing beats the thrill of game day at Jordan-Hare Stadium! War Damn Eagle!

My research focuses on Hopfield neural networks, data science, and quantitative finance, with a passion for bridging theoretical advancements with real-world applications. Whether it’s developing new algorithms or mentoring students, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with others.
